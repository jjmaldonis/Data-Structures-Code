#Project Description
This code implements an undirected graph with nodes, neighbors, and weighed edges between nodes. It is fairly basic so far but it does what it is supposed to.

#Code Description
This code iterates of a series of input files as specified in the main() function, reads in and stores a graph (as long as the file is in the correct format), and prints out some information illustrating that the code works properly. The code is fairly self explanitory.

#Execution instructions
From a terminal run 'python graph.py'. The files g1.txt and g2.txt must be in the same folder as graph.py and must have the correct format(which is also fairly self explanatory if you look at the txt files).

#Reflection
It was interesting to actually find a viable use of storing dictionaries inside of dictionaries.
After completing this portion of the project I am still not sure how I should correctly modify my code to add all the nodes in first and then add in the neighbors of the nodes after all the nodes have been entered. This is one shortcoming of my code and I need to think of a good way to fix it (I have one idea but I don't like it).
The biggest problem I faced was figuring out how I wanted to write my input. I decided to somewhat copy the gml graph format but I tweeked it slightly.
I liked what we went over in class as far as you telling us what we should have known beforehand. That helped considerably.
