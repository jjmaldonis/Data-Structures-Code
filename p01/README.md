#Project Description
This code provides us with three sorting algorithms coded in Python, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort. Note that merge sort is generally very fast with O(n log(n)). The downside to merge sort is that it needs more memory because when you merge two lists you need another list to put them into (so it's double the memory). Quicksort is the slowest it can ever be when the elements are all the same. Insertion sort is fast when you have a pre-sorted list and just want to add another element in the correct spot. You can use these algorithms in the future now! Also, quicksort works the best if you choose a random number from the list; it works pretty much as well if you do the average (although note that you don't insert the pivot and drop it when you run it recursively).

#Code Description
This code generates a list shuffled numbers from 0 to 99 and sorts them using the three sorting techniques discussed above.

#Execution Instructions
cd into the correct directory and type "python [insert sort name].py" in a terminal to execute this code.

#Reflection
I actually enjoyed going through the quicksort algorithm in class. I first I thought it was just going to take a long time, and it did, but I at least learned something from it. I liked programming up the code because now I can use it easily in the future. I also really like programming in Python, its so much faster than C++!
After the day in class (today) that we did the quicksort algorithm I think I understand everything about this project.
The biggest problem I faced was getting the i and j values correct in the quicksort and also making sure I put the lists back together correctly after I sorted the left and right side of the pivot (once it was swapped into its correct position). You helped me resolve the length issue (I was including the pivot at the end of the list instead of ignoring it when swapping i and j). I figured out the other stuff by thinking about it and trial and error.
I think that we covered everything we needed to in class that I would have wanted to know beforehand so I don't think there is anything else I would add.
